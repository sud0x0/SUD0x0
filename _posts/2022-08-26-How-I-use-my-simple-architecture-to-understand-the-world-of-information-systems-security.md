title: How I use my simple architecture to understand the world of information systems security?
ecle, I believe that having a correct understanding of the following terms is important. Therefore, I thought to place them at the top of the article. The meanings were taken from NIST glossary. 

[Cyber security](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/cyber_security) means the ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber-attacks.

[Cyberspace](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/cyberspace) means a global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.

An [information environment](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/information_environment) means the aggregate of individuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or act on information.

An [information system](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/information_system) is a discrete set of information resources organized for the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.

[Information resources](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/information_resources) means information and related resources, such as personnel, equipment, funds, and information technology.

[Information systems security](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/information_systems_security) means the protection of information systems against unauthorized access to or modification of information, whether in storage, processing, or transit, and against the denial of service to authorized users, including those measures necessary to detect, document, and counter such threats.

[Information security](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/information_security) means the protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

An [enterprise](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/enterprise) means an organization with a defined mission/goal and a defined boundary, using information systems to execute that mission, and with responsibility for managing its own risks and performance.

I personally understand information systems security as a combination of both cyber security and information security. The NIST definition for information systems does not directly mention whether non-technical systems (such as a file cabinet) are considered information systems or not. But some of the definitions that are on the internet describe an information system as a sociotechnical system. Even definitions for information systems do not cover paper-based non-technical methods directly, there is a significant portion of physical security and information classification integrated into information systems security. The image below describes how I see these relationships.

A side note: CISO is one of the highest roles assigned to the enterprise information security architecture within an organisation.  The CISO handbook, written by cio.gov, mentions that security of both information and information systems is a responsibility of the CISO. It also mentions that a CISO should use standards such as FIPS 199. FIPS 199 covers both information (electronic or non-electronic) and information systems. Consequently, I believe that understanding information systems security as a combination of both information security and cyber security is the correct method.
